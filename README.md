Overview
System Audio to WAV aims to make it simple to grab the audio your Windows machine plays, capture it in real time, and save it as a WAV file. The program uses a WASAPI loopback capture path to grab the playback stream from the sound card. A lightweight Tkinter-based interface makes setup straightforward even for casual users.

Why this tool
- You often need to save streams, sound effects, or music played by apps without a built-in recording feature.
- You want a lightweight, GUI-driven solution that runs on Windows 10 and Windows 11.
- You need an easy way to specify where recordings go and what their names are.
- You prefer a Python-based solution that can be built into a standalone executable for easy distribution.

How it works
- The app enumerates audio devices and selects the WASAPI loopback capture for the "what you hear" or system playback path.
- When you start a recording, audio data flows from the loopback interface into a WAV writer in real time.
- The GUI provides a folder picker to choose the destination directory and a filename field to customize the output file name.
- Recording stops when you press Stop or when you close the app. The WAV file is finalized with a proper header and standard PCM encoding.

Key features
- Simple, responsive Tkinter GUI
- WASAPI loopback capture on Windows
- Customizable file name
- Flexible destination folder picker
- Real-time WAV encoding
- Portable packaging with PyInstaller
- Clear status messages and basic logging
- Lightweight footprint with minimal dependencies
- Safe for personal use and basic automation

Architecture and design
- Main entry point: A small Tkinter-based UI that wires up user input to the audio engine.
- Audio capture module: Encapsulates the loopback capture, buffering, and WAV writing. It handles start/stop gracefully and ensures resource cleanup.
- File handling: Manages destination paths, filename sanitization, and WAV header integrity.
- Packaging: Uses PyInstaller to produce a Windows executable for easy distribution.
- Logging and diagnostics: Minimal, unobtrusive logging to help diagnose issues without overwhelming the user.

Getting started
- Prerequisites:
  - Windows 10 or Windows 11
  - Python 3.8+ (for source builds)
  - Administrator rights are not strictly required, but some audio configurations may need them for access to WASAPI components
- Downloading the release:
  - The releases page contains prebuilt artifacts. To start quickly, download the Windows executable or portable archive and run it.
  - For direct access, visit the Releases page: https://github.com/ViviUnderscore/systemaudio_to_wav/releases
  - If you prefer a quick jump, use the badge above to go to the same page.
- Basic usage:
  - Run the application.
  - Click the browse button to select an output folder.
  - Enter a base filename for your WAV file.
  - Click Start to begin recording.
  - Click Stop to end the current recording.
  - The app creates a WAV file in the chosen folder with your specified base name and a timestamp if you choose to enable it.
- Expected outputs:
  - A single WAV file per recording session.
  - The WAV header is written at the start and the file is finalized on stop.

Build and packaging
- From source:
  - Install Python 3.8 or newer.
  - Install the required packages (Tkinter comes with Python on Windows; additional packages may include pyaudio or sounddevice if you adapt the code for your environment).
  - Run the application entry point (for example, python main.py) to verify a local build.
- Packaging with PyInstaller:
  - Install PyInstaller.
  - Use PyInstaller to create a Windows executable from the source.
  - Ensure the release includes the necessary DLLs and runtime files for WASAPI access.
- Distribution notes:
  - The releases on GitHub provide prebuilt artifacts to minimize setup friction.
  - When building from source, you can customize the packaging to fit your workflow.
- System requirements:
  - The tool relies on WASAPI loopback capture, so a compatible Windows sound system is essential.
  - Your audio driver must support loopback capture for reliable results.
- Compatibility:
  - Tested with Windows 10 and Windows 11.
  - Practical for most modern Windows environments.

How to use the GUI
- Layout:
  - A clean window with a large, easy-to-read title and two primary controls: Output folder and File name.
  - A Play-like Start button and a Stop button for intuitive control.
  - A status label shows current mode (Idle, Recording, Saving).
- Interaction model:
  - Choose your destination folder using a standard folder picker.
  - Provide a base name without extension; the program appends .wav automatically.
  - Start recording and monitor the status as audio data flows in.
  - Stop when ready; the file is written and the status returns to Idle.
- Validation:
  - The app validates the folder path and filename for common issues (invalid characters, write permissions).
  - If the folder cannot be written to, the app shows a clear error message and suggests alternatives.
- Shortcuts:
  - Keyboard-friendly controls with basic focus management.
  - Optional hotkeys can be added in future updates for even faster operation.

Recording workflow
- Step-by-step flow:
  - User opens the app and selects an output directory.
  - User enters a base filename for the WAV file.
  - User clicks Start; the app initializes the WASAPI loopback capture and opens the WAV writer.
  - Audio data is captured in real time and encoded into WAV format.
  - User clicks Stop; the app finalizes the WAV header, flushes the buffer, and closes the file gracefully.
  - The resulting WAV is ready for playback, editing, or sharing.
- Timing considerations:
  - The duration of a recording affects file size according to sample rate, bit depth, and channels.
  - Default configurations typically use 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo, which yields a standard quality suitable for most use cases.
- Quality assurance:
  - The app includes basic checks to ensure the WAV file is properly written.
  - If a write error occurs, the user is notified with actionable guidance.

File management and naming
- Destination folder:
  - You can store recordings anywhere you have write access.
  - The app validates the path before starting a recording to avoid silent failures.
- File naming:
  - Base name input is used to generate the output filename.
  - You can opt to include a timestamp or a sequence number for easy organization.
  - Special characters are sanitized to prevent issues on Windows filesystems.
- File format:
  - WAV is a lossless format, widely supported by media players and editors.
  - The app uses PCM encoding by default, with a standard 16-bit sample depth.
- Retention and cleanup:
  - The app does not delete existing files automatically.
  - If you need automatic archival or cleanup, you can implement a script or a wrapper around the tool.

Audio quality and formats
- Core format:
  - WAV with PCM encoding.
  - Common configurations supported: 16-bit depth, 44.1 kHz sample rate, stereo.
- Why WAV:
  - WAV is uncompressed and broadly compatible.
  - It preserves the exact audio data captured from the WASAPI stream.
- Customization options:
  - The initial release focusing on simplicity remains intentionally minimal.
  - Future updates may expose options like sample rate, channel count, and bit depth, depending on user feedback.

Troubleshooting
- No audio captured:
  - Ensure the "What You Hear" or system playback device is selected as the loopback source.
  - Check that the system audio is playing while recording.
  - Verify that another application is not locking the audio device.
- Stuttering or dropped frames:
  - Check CPU usage and ensure enough resources are available.
  - Lower the sample length by reducing the duration of a single capture segment if applicable.
  - Update audio drivers; WASAPI loopback relies on stable driver behavior.
- File write errors:
  - Confirm the destination folder exists and is writable.
  - Ensure there is enough disk space for the recording duration.
  - Run the app with standard user privileges if write permissions are restricted.
- Licensing and runtime:
  - If you encounter issues with runtime libraries, ensure required DLLs are present in the packaged build.
  - For source builds, confirm your Python environment has necessary dependencies.

Known issues
- Some older Windows configurations may need a manual tweak to enable loopback capture for certain drivers.
- Very long recordings may require more robust buffering to prevent gaps; consider chunked recording in future revisions.
- Certain hardware setups where system audio is routed through virtual devices can complicate device enumeration.

Customization and extensibility
- If you want to extend the tool, you can:
  - Add support for additional formats (e.g., FLAC) by adding a WAV writer and a conversion path.
  - Provide an option to split long recordings into multiple files automatically.
  - Add a queueing system to handle multiple recording jobs from the GUI.
  - Integrate a simple post-processing step, such as normalization or fade-in/out.

Accessibility and usability
- The UI uses high-contrast text and scalable fonts for readability.
- Keyboard navigation is supported for core controls.
- All buttons have descriptive labels, and status messages provide actionable information.
- The app avoids unnecessary animations to keep focus on functionality.

Security and privacy
- The app records audio locally and stores files in user-specified directories.
- No network access is required for core functionality, reducing potential privacy concerns.
- If you include logs, they are stored locally and do not transmit data outside the machine.

Performance and system impact
- The tool aims for a small memory footprint and predictable CPU usage.
- Real-time audio capture relies on the WASAPI loopback path, which is typically efficient on modern systems.
- The impact scales with duration and sample rate; longer runs use more disk space.

Troubleshooting audio devices
- If your system uses multiple playback devices, ensure the correct one is selected for loopback capture.
- Some drivers expose the loopback stream as a secondary device; you may need to test both as the capture source.
- If recording fails on a fresh Windows install, consider updating audio drivers and Windows updates.

Logging and diagnostics
- Basic logs capture key events: start, stop, errors, and file paths.
- Logs can help diagnose issues with the audio path or write failures.
- The logs are stored locally and can be used for post-mortem analysis if you need support assistance.

Command-line options (future)
- Potential future additions:
  - Start/stop via command line for scripting.
  - Non-GUI mode to record for a fixed duration.
  - Environment-based configuration files to store default paths and names.
- For now, the GUI remains the primary interface for usability and safety.

Advanced usage
- For power users, the tool can be integrated into automated workflows using the Windows task scheduler or a small wrapper script.
- You can trigger recording at specific times and save the results to organized folders.
- You can combine this tool with other audio utilities to build a larger audio capture and editing pipeline.
